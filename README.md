# instagram clone MERN 

Instagram Clone is a social media application designed to mimic the features and functionalities of the Instagram platform. Using the Mongo, Express, React/Redux, and Node.js framework, this application includes features such as login/register, forgot password, reset password, following other users, liking and commenting on posts, and much more.

There are still many features we haven't implemented yet, and the frontend is still under development. Please be patient and stay tuned.
